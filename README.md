R for CHNNS (Computational Human Neural Networking Simulation)
==

This project is based on computational simulation of human neural networking by R. Some of the ideas come from the generosity of biopunks and R lovers.
I appreciate for their contribution and open mind, the project won't be established if there is no effort they gave on this net.

Computational Simulation of Human Neural Networking, the term sounds weird and sort of like those come from Mary Sherley's fiction. Over the last several decades computer technology was improved and developed so quick that we are stepping into an era of information. 
However there is one more thing: we human beings are still not getting ideas of our own body, how it works, how our cognitivity comes and why we developed civilisation and language in the long history of *homo sapien*.

From the end of last century to the beginning of this century the Human Genome Project helped us, for the first time, to get known about our genetic information stored in 3 billion base pairs from Human DNA, we once had the chance to look deep into ourselves and start to create drug for diseases due to genetic problems. Yes there are many more we are still working one, cancer, for instance, is the biggest challenge blocking our way to a healthier future, but we are trying and one day we will definitly take it down.

I want to mention another aspect of human body, our brain.
